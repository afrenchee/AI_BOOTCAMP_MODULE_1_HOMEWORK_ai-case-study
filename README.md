# A Case Study on Tesla's Full Self Driving (Supervised) Software



## Overview and Origin

* Tesla Inc, formally know as Tesla Motors Inc, was founded on July 1st 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, with additional co-founders Ian Wright, Elon Musk, and J. B. Straubel joining throughout 2003 to 2005. While Tesla is a company that primarily focuses on producing electric cars, since 2014 they have also been working on autonomous driving. The "autopilot team" is the group of engineers working at Tesla to develp a self driving software that enables a Robotaxi, driver-less experience in any Tesla vehicle. Tesla is a publically traded company which, and also recieves Regulatory Credits from the government for selling electric cars. While in their early days they heavily relied on recieving credits and then selling them to other automotive companies, they have been profitable without needing to sell them since Q1 2021.



## Business Activities

* Tesla is working on solving autonomous driving in their electric cars. Every Tesla shipped since October 2016 has included the hardware required to run their Full Self Driving (Supervised) software. The hardware consists of eight cameras that see in every direction around the car. Older versions included radar and ultrasonic sensors, however those have been removed in order to focus on a vision only approach, mimicking how humans drive by looking around and making decisions. FSD(s) is an optional software addition that Tesla owners can either purchase outright for $8000, or subscribe to it for $99 per month. When it comes to developing a fully autonomous car, the main advantage Tesla has is their method of data collection. Since every Tesla that has shipped since October 2016 has the hardware required, whether or not the driver purchases the software, every Tesla is using it's cameras to send data back to their supercomputer cluster, where the bad drivers are sorted out, and the good drivers video data is labeled for Machine Learning. This level of scale is far larger in terms of data collection than any of their competitors developing autonomous vehicles. Elon Musk tweeted on August 3rd, 2024 "Just did a walk through of the Tesla supercomputer cluster... This will be ~100k H100/H200 with massive storage for video training of FSD...". So they have millions of vehicles constantly sending data to their massive training hardware setup. The most recent development with their FSD(s) software was a recent major update that removed over 300K lines of hard code, and made a complete overhaul were their code is now 100% AI using a single neural network that controls everything from vision in to vehicle control outputs. As developments of the software are made, and it's performance improves, over-the-air software updates are rolled out to everyone using it, so the users car continues to get batter with time.



## Landscape

* Tesla, a leader in the electric vehicle industry, has been at the forefront of the autonomous driving field with its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software. The hardware required to build an autonomous vehicle has only really came about over the last few years, making this a very new industry. Major trends in this field include the rapid advancement of AI and machine learning software and hardware, the integration of vision based technology, and the shift towards fully autonomous ride-hailing services. Key innovations have centered on improving real-time decision-making, safety, and expanding autonomous capabilities from highway driving to urban environments. Other major companies in this field include Waymo (Alphabet), Cruise (General Motors), and Argo AI (Ford/Volkswagen), all of whom are developing competing autonomous driving systems, however do have nearly the scale that Tesla does in terms of data and geographical availability. A Tesla can use it's FSD(s) software anywhere in America and Canada, with future roll outs planned in other continents.



## Results

* Tesla's Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software has significantly impacted the business by enhancing the appeal of its autonomous driving technologies. Core metrics in this field include miles driven in autonomous mode, the accuracy and safety of the autonomous system, and the rate of software updates and improvements. Tesla leads in miles driven with real-world data from its vast fleet, giving it a competitive edge in refining its FSD software. While competitors like Waymo and Cruise focus on fully autonomous operations in controlled environments, Tesla's approach of continuous over-the-air updates and real-time data collection has allowed it to scale rapidly, maintaining a strong performance relative to its peers.



## Recommendations

* To further strengthen Tesla's position in the autonomous driving market, I would recommend trying to accelerate development of the companies autonomous ride-hailing service, similar to Waymo's model, also knows as a "Robotaxi". This service would allow Tesla owners to monetize their cars Full Self-Driving (Supervised) technology more directly by tapping into the growing demand for convenient, on-demand transportation. When they launch Robotaxi, owners can send their car out autonomously to drive around giving users taxi rides without a driver, making both Tesla and the owner money. Implementing this service would leverage Tesla's existing FSD software, AI-powered route optimization, and fleet management technologies, all of which are well-suited to providing efficient and safe autonomous rides. This approach would create a new revenue stream, accelerate the adoption of autonomous vehicles, and enhance Tesla's competitive edge in the mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) industry.
